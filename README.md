Update of Neronix17s mod
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1567775191

- The robes and hood will now be considered cultist-clothing if using https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2249174783]Call of Cthulhu - Cults
- Removed dependencies since the mod never got content that required them
- Robes and Hood now have similar properties as the Psyfocus Robe and Skullcap if Royalty is used.
