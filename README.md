Update of Neronix17s mod
https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1567775191

**The release of RimWorld 1.6 added improved support for [Asset Bundles](https://github.com/emipa606/AssetBuilder/blob/main/README.md)**.
To avoid doubling the size of the mod, it was re-released using only Asset Bundles, you can find the previous version of this mod [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2397464835).

- The robes and hood will now be considered cultist-clothing if using [Call of Cthulhu - Cults](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2249174783)
- Removed dependencies since the mod never got content that required them
- Robes and Hood now have similar properties as the Psyfocus Robe and Skullcap if Royalty is used.
